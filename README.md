 524 project
 
Class project
Project description
Group Create a two-person group. (You can work alone if you want, but the expectations will be the same as for a two-person group.)
Topic Select a prediction problem and register it with me.
You should have a motivation for why this prediction problem is potentially interesting/important.
You should also know whether/where you're able to get the data.
Important In addition to an outcome variable, you are going to need a decent set of predictors.
Also important The datasets that we've used in class are off limits—as are anything in ISLR.
Still important Groups cannot overlap in topics. First mover wins.
Data Gather data.
Test Randomly select approximately 20% of your data for a test set. (Don't train on it until everything is done.)
Train Apply "best" techniques to clean, train, and predict. Use four different algorithms—one of which should be a regression-based model (unless it is not possible in your context).
CV error Estimate your error using cross validation.
Test Test your performance with the held out data.
Reports Create the following reports (see materials due, below).
Materials due
By 10am on March 12th, submit on Canvas:

Kaggle notebook with (commented) analysis code and figures
1-page "executive summary" (see below for format)
4-slide summary following paragraphs 2–5 of the executive summary (below)
Evaluation of your group members
NOTE: No late submissions accepted.

Notebook
Your Kaggle notebook should have sections (e.g., "data", "cleaning", "tuning", "training", "prediction") and should be heavily commented. Create figures—both to visualize your data and to deepen your understanding of the results/predictions/tuning.

This notebook should look clean enough to send to a potential employer.

Executive summary
The executive summary should be organized and written well. Specifically, it should follow this outline.

Paragraph 2: The big picture

your project's question
why the question is important/interesting
what makes this a prediction problem
Paragraph 3: Data

sources
cleaning
challenges
shortcomings
Paragraph 4: Methods

learning methods applied
tuned parameters
method for tuning
Paragraph 5: Results and conclusion

how you measure performance/success
how your models perform
what you think limited your performance
what you learned in this process
Paragraph 1: Brief overview of paragraphs 2–5

Presentation
You will present a 4-slide summary paragraphs 2–5 of the executive summary (above).

Do not include all of the information from the four paragraphs. Your presentation should be a graphical companion to the other two reports. Again, it should be high enough quality to send to a prospective employer.

Evaluation
Submit a short evaluation of whether you and your group-member equally distributed work—or if the work was unequal. If it was unequal, describe to what extent it was unequal and whether you believe you should receive the same grade


Our notes:
 Start here:
  - Nina has university data (price per year over 200 years; enrollment by in- vs out-of-state and associated prices, ethnicity ratios; gender ratios retention rates)
  - her project: impact of tuition increases on enrollment levels of low-income students
  - predict? price of tuition based on prev year's prices
  - predict? enrollment rates based on price issues (by group?)
  - predict? retention rates based on price issues (by group?)
  - predict? minority enrollment based on other school culture factors such as majority white (or difference in school composition by race and local community racial composition) etc .

Ed Says:
  - used (time, instution, etc?) fixed effects and time series data 
  - predict retention OR predict who will leave (numbers of them, who will be the leavers?)
